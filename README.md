This is a simple employee management system built with Django, designed to manage employee records efficiently. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and includes user authentication for secure access.
Features
* Add, update, view, and delete employee records.
* Implemented user authentication to restrict access to the system.
* Field-level permissions: authenticated users can update specific fields of an employee's record, while others remain restricted.
